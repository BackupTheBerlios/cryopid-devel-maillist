Yes, its always better to get a blessing. The only time I fork otherwise
is if the original author just can not be contacted, or if I need
something to go in a very different direction.

&gt;<i> DVCS would be my preference. hg or git is immaterial to me except that

A few minutes, really. What we'd want to do is decide if we want both
supported architectures in the same repository. After that all I have to
do is check in the code and push it.

I'm not married to Mercurial, its just what I happen to use most
frequently.

ShareSource is soon unveiling a Xen based build farm, which enables us
to have nightly builds across various distributions and architectures.

If I'm not mistaken, we'll also be able to run tests as well. 

The first thing I intend to do is introduce autoconf and attack the
makefile, secondly would be a test suite based on TAP (test anything
protocol).

The other question is, would it be prudent to send patches here (first)
for all of us to review prior to committing? I think for a little while,
yes, if only to keep us from duplicating efforts.

&gt;<i> Sounds good. Like I say, I'll send out that email tomorrow. I'll also
</I>&gt;<i> go ahead and autogen some documentation- call graphs, that sort of
</I>&gt;<i> thing- to help make the learning curve a little less steep, maybe get
</I>&gt;<i> some more developers in.
</I>
That would help.

Cheers,
