pax is going to be a _very_ interesting problem, which also bleeds into
saving groups (who might be using a randomized mmap). By that token,
futexes also become interesting upon restarting a group, more so that
mutexes, even without randomization. Processes would just re-start into
deadlock or segfaults.

I don't see either working in the immediate future. But a working build
is quite (as you said) easy. If the project gets re-introduced to
Debian, its likely we can get a few GSOC students next year as well.

&gt;<i> OK, let's move and hope we'll find the solution.

I'd like to wait a few days to see if Bernard can still be found. It
takes very little time to set up a repository, bug tracker and wiki.

Ideally, we are able to keep this same mailing list, since its already
got subscribers and is (likely?) mentioned in distro documentation.
That's one of the many reasons why I hope to hear back from Bernard.

Cheers,
--Tim
