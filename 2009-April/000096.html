Great.

About a year ago, I asked if the project was maintained. The author
indicated that he'd love to work on it, but has very little time. He
also indicated that he'd be happy to see the project find a new home.

I replied to that (year old) thread and CC'd him, hopefully his e-mail
has not changed since then.

</I>
One of the things I asked (you'll see the thread) is if he has some sort
of repository so that we can just pick up with it, or import the
history.

I think most people who would be interested in working on it in the
future would prefer a DVCS.  


&gt;<i> Being honest, I don't have enough experience with this code to take

</I>&gt;<i> matters too much right now- the question of who's in charge of a dead
</I>&gt;<i> project is pretty much moot.
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion would be that we just start by integrating your changes,

</I>&gt;<i> up, hunting down the existing bugs, and start fixing them. We can
</I>&gt;<i> cross the ego bridge when we 
</I>&gt;<i> come to it, you know?
</I>
I was thinking the same, lets get it going again and start going after
the lower hanging fruit.

After that, the project should just find / take on its own natural
order, yes?

In other words, I don't think any of us want to take the lead, so at
this point, I don't see why there has to be a lead, unless the original
author wants to help transition things. Right now, I'm just happy to get
it building again on modern systems.

Cheers,
--Tim
