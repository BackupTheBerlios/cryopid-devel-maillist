<PRE>hi guys,
i know this list is no longer maintained but i find cryopid a great tool.
i was recently working on it and was trying to hibernate network programs
(simple client- server with sockets)
i was able to hibernate and resume this socket programs by restoring the
sockets. cryopid works great and with some modifications can be used to
hibernate all kinds of programs.


secondly, i also feel that the way cryopid creates the ELF of the process
being freezed can also be used as a debugging tool.
it can allow us to change the flow of execution of a program all together.
i.e can be used as hack.

it would really be great if everyone start working on its development.
make it compatible with all types of kernels and improve its performance.

its worth studying CRYOPID in detail.

I would appreciate any help that would make me understand the exact flow of
ELF creation along with how the addresses are set and control is transfered
to the process being resume when the ELF is run.

Can anyone give me short program that would generate an ELF the way cryopid
does.

thanks...........
