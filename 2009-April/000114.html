<PRE>Hi,

As you know I am working on bringing the build of CryoPID under the
control of autoconf (note, not automake, just autoconf).

As far as I can tell, beyond the typical 'configure' options, we will
need the following:

--disable-tcpcp (currently enabled by default)
--enable-gtk (currently disabled by default)

No external library path is needed (or should be passed to) these
directives, since they simply introduce internal wrappers.

The GTK support (can) use gtk/gtk.h if its present, however it isn't
really needed, unless GTK completely breaks their existing interface by
shuffling types.

There is one assertion in the wrapper which is defined if gtk/gtk.h is
not included:

#define GTK_IS_WINDOW(x) (1) /* Bleh, live with the assertions */

Which would normally call GTK_CHECK_TYPE on x. I am not a GTK wizard, so
if someone else wants to chime in on depending on gtk for build that
would be great. From the research I did, it seems like this is a pretty
harmless assertion (given how we use it), however I'd be more
comfortable with someone well versed in GTK looking into it.

Finally, I am planning on tracking the configure script itself in the
repository. I know its 6k lines, but it doesn't force potential
contributors to have autotools of a specific version installed. If they
have them, they can use them.

I should have a kernel agnostic build committed by the end of the week.

BTW, The project is finally live at ShareSource with everything working.
again, anyone needing commit access needs only to register and e-mail me
with your username.

Cheers,
--Tim
