</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone know who was maintaining it for Debian? It looks like it was
</I>&gt;<i> removed:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=507882">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=507882</A>&gt;
</I>

Not sure, but I can find out. I'll was going to hop on the IRC tomorrow
anyway, so
I'll ask around a bit while I'm there.


 Well, its going to eventually become a fork, if fork is defined as going
&gt;<i> in a different direction than the original author. Since the original
</I>&gt;<i> author has abandoned the project, really, any forward movement is going
</I>&gt;<i> to be a fork.
</I>

Sorry, I misunderstood you. I'm just saying that we need to make sure we
have
the appropriate permissions to be acting on behalf of cryopid rather than as
a
new project. Probably the best way to do that is to get the blessings of the
original
authors, if we can track them down.

As noted above, I would agree that (right now) its best to just fix the
&gt;<i> bugs that are known, get it back in distro circulation, then work on the
</I>&gt;<i> bugs that haven't been properly reported.
</I>

I agree.

If you guys like, I can set up a HG repo, bug tracker and wiki at
&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://sharesource.org">http://sharesource.org</A> (I'm an admin there).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I haven't messed around much with mercurial, but I can pick it up. Like you
say, I think the
big thing is just to get the project going again, so the choice of venue is
much more likely to be
fortuitous than calamitous.

Being honest, I don't have enough experience with this code to take lead,
but I don't think that
matters too much right now- the question of who's in charge of a dead
project is pretty much moot.
My suggestion would be that we just start by integrating your changes,
setting a project page back
up, hunting down the existing bugs, and start fixing them. We can cross the
ego bridge when we
come to it, you know?
