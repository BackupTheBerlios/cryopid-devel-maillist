You're right, it was a bit of a challenge. While hg convert offers the
ability to specify the tags, trunk and branches, doing this resulted in
a completely backwards (and partially missing) history. Attempting to
just specify the tags didn't work either.

So, I just did the convert, which got the history 100% correct, but the
repo was more or less an identical clone of the subversion repo (with
cryopid/trunk/ cryopid/tags/ cryopid/branches/ etc).

I then went to the last tagged release, backed out the commit just after
the release so that tags/0.5.9.1 was just as it was when you last
released. I then hg mv'ed that tag to the repository root, and then hg
rm -f' ed cryopid/. This converted it to the typical Mercurial layout.

Then, I just had to go through the history to restore the tags, which
wasn't too difficult.

Finally, I added a tag 0.5.9.1-1 , which points to the current location
of the 0.5.9.1 tag.

So, should you clone to a tag prior to 0.5.9.1-1, you'll get the old SVN
style layout. If you clone as-is (completely), you'll see a single tree
that is identical to the last official release.

Note, I did not attempt to restore the SVN branches, as they really are
not needed. What we have now is a single master branch, from which other
Mercurial branches can be created.

The point is, tags and history are preserved. There are no unresolved
heads. The only thing that _might_ be quirky is getting individual file
logs, some of them may stop at r30. This is no big deal, since r30 is so
long ago, nobody would be bisecting that far back.

The end result is here:

<A HREF="http://echoreply.us/hg/cryopid.hg">http://echoreply.us/hg/cryopid.hg</A>

I've tested it, it builds find on my (older) Ubuntu desktop. If that
looks ok to everyone, I'll go ahead and push it to ShareSource. Given
the complexity of the original repo, I think coming out with history and
tags in tact is the best we can do.

Anyone playing with it, do a hg archive ../cryo-testing , then test in
the archived copy. hgignore is not yet set up, so you might accidentally
start tracking rubbish files. 


&gt;<i> &gt; Is it a problem to keep this list going where it currently lives? If I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not mistaken, its mentioned in documentation and in many tutorials
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scattered around the web.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It shouldn't be an issue. I'll try and recover the Berlios list
</I>&gt;<i> password.
</I>
That would be great. Thank you again for all of your help. Hopefully you
can continue at some point, if you are able to find the time and
interest.

Thanks again!

Cheers,
--Tim
