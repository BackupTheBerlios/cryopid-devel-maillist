Some. Last year I was working on a specialized cluster interconnect that
behaved over wide area networks. We managed to use CryoPID internally to
freeze a process and migrate it to another node. It was racy in some
uses, but overall worked well.

It was a proof of concept which we did not end up using, but during that
time I did explore the code a bit.

Bernard isn't actively working on it, but will be watching the bulk of
patches that come through. If we're in danger of doing something
completely stupid, he'll let us know.

I think it will take more than a few days to really understand the code.
I think you should allow at least a month, depending on how familiar you
are with the kernel. As far as the kernel goes, I'm &quot;just ok&quot;, I hope
working on this improves that. Most of my kernel hacking has gone into
drivers or file systems.

One thing you can do, as you understand functions and innards, comment
them and send patches. Doxygen format is great for that. It took three
of us a week (a while back on this list) to figure out if an
inconsistency in fork2() was deliberate.

However, build issues (such as missing headers, structures that no
longer contain certain members, etc) can be worked around rather easily.

for instance:

#if HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include &quot;config.h&quot;
#endif

#if HAVE_FOO_H
#include &lt;foo.h&gt;
#else
 ... (work around) ..
#endif

Or ...

#if #FOO_HAS_MEMBER_BAR
   .bar = ptr;
#else
   .renamed_bar = ptr;
#endif

Of course, those are simplified meta examples.

In most cases, something is either renamed, moved to another header,
etc. As far as I can tell, nothing we use was completely depreciated, or
building on older 2.6 kernels would have issued a warning.

Autoconf can help to fix those issues, while we maintain backwards
compatibility. 

AC_CHECK_HEADER[] and AC_CHECK_MEMBER[] is really all that's needed to
sort that kind of stuff out. This lets us know if a header exists, if
so, does it contain a structure, if so, is a particular item a member of
that structure.

Constants / flags are simpler and should not often rely on config.h.

&gt;<i> OMG :D
</I>
Yeah, thankfully, in about a month, I'm back on 5MB DSL. The DSLAM in
our area was packed, there was a long waiting list so I settled for a
cheap wireless connection.

Cheers!
