Great! We are all anxious to start digging in. Its still a very useful
program (especially in forensics), seems a shame to see it dropped from
Debian.

I just checked out a full copy, however a .tgz of the repo would be
handy. I think most involved want to use a DVCS such as Mercurial, so
I'm going to see if I can import up to 0.5.9.1 while preserving the
entire history.

Hopefully that goes quickly, if not we'll probably continue with
Subversion until the conversion can be done correctly. Even then, it
would be good to keep the original repository available for historical /
reference purposes.

Yes, thanks for the heads up and all of your work thus far. We're not
sure how far we'll get at first, hopefully just getting it back in
distro circulation will attract some more people to development.

Is it a problem to keep this list going where it currently lives? If I'm
not mistaken, its mentioned in documentation and in many tutorials
scattered around the web. 

Again, thank you for your blessing.

Cheers,
--Tim
