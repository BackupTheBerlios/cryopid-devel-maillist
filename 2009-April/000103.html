Sadly, the initial structure of the repo wasn't a nice trunk/,
tags/, branches/ setup, and so importing it into hg seems to get a
little complicated. I've uploaded to relevant svndump if anyone
wants to give it a shot:
  <A HREF="http://dagobah.ucc.asn.au/cryopid-only-svn.dump.bz2">http://dagobah.ucc.asn.au/cryopid-only-svn.dump.bz2</A>

Revision 30 is where it takes the standard trunk/tags/branches form,
and that doesn't play nicely with hg convert. It might take a bit of
svndump hacking.

I completely agree. That would be wonderful.

It shouldn't be an issue. I'll try and recover the Berlios list
password.

Cheers,
Bernard.
