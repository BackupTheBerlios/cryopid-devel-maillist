It does. The problem is the repo changed structure .. which makes any
conversion rather interesting :)

SS will soon support git, a two way mirror won't be that hard. Since
there is no defined lead for this revival, I'm sure most changes will be
pull requests anyway.

It is now maintained. Please allow some time for us to fix the
outstanding issues. One of the great points of CryoPID is that it works
on any kernel, 2.4 + .. that's something that (at least I) would like to
preserve.

So, off to m4 hell I go. :)

There is a project page, <A HREF="http://sharesource.org/project/cryopid/">http://sharesource.org/project/cryopid/</A>

I have set up the main page, wiki, bug tracker and uploaded the last
official release-0.5.9.1 as file releases. The HG repo is set up,
however SS is currently doing maintenance, so it won't be available
there for a couple of hours (you'll get a 500 at the time of this
writing). Note, I did that in a couple of hours .. please forgive (and
point out) any typos, etc.

The first task is obviously to fix the build bugs while maintaining
compatibility with older kernels, so that the project can get back into
distro circulation, I've already mirrored the Debian report in the bug
tracker.

Cheers,
--Tim
