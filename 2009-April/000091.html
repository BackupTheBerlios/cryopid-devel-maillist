Does anyone know who was maintaining it for Debian? It looks like it was
removed:

<A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=507882">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=507882</A>

The original mentors package counted on updates from upstream, which
obviously did not happen.

I agree, at this point, its better to just take over maintenance of the
program so that it can be re-introduced.

What is mentioned in the removal request was 'other bugs', but they
weren't reported in the Debian bug tracker. Going back a year in list
archives (here), all I saw were the build related bugs.

Well, its going to eventually become a fork, if fork is defined as going
in a different direction than the original author. Since the original
author has abandoned the project, really, any forward movement is going
to be a fork.

As noted above, I would agree that (right now) its best to just fix the
bugs that are known, get it back in distro circulation, then work on the
bugs that haven't been properly reported. 

If you guys like, I can set up a HG repo, bug tracker and wiki at
<A HREF="http://sharesource.org">http://sharesource.org</A> (I'm an admin there). I've got some patches that
introduced autoconf to help get around the build issue, but I think
they're now stale. If at least the build is fixed and some active site
for the project is established, I'm sure a MOTU could be persuaded to
put it back in.

Anyway, if someone else is willing to take over primary maintenance, I'm
willing to help as much as I can. I'm comfortable with some of the code,
but the majority of it still makes my head hurt.

Cheers,
--Tim
