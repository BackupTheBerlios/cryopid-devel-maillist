</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then, I just had to go through the history to restore the tags, which

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I added a tag 0.5.9.1-1 , which points to the current location
</I>&gt;<i> of the 0.5.9.1 tag.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, should you clone to a tag prior to 0.5.9.1-1, you'll get the old SVN
</I>&gt;<i> style layout. If you clone as-is (completely), you'll see a single tree
</I>&gt;<i> that is identical to the last official release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note, I did not attempt to restore the SVN branches, as they really are
</I>&gt;<i> not needed. What we have now is a single master branch, from which other
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial branches can be created.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The point is, tags and history are preserved. There are no unresolved
</I>&gt;<i> heads. The only thing that _might_ be quirky is getting individual file
</I>&gt;<i> logs, some of them may stop at r30. This is no big deal, since r30 is so
</I>&gt;<i> long ago, nobody would be bisecting that far back.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The end result is here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://echoreply.us/hg/cryopid.hg">http://echoreply.us/hg/cryopid.hg</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've tested it, it builds find on my (older) Ubuntu desktop. If that
</I>&gt;<i> looks ok to everyone, I'll go ahead and push it to ShareSource. Given
</I>&gt;<i> the complexity of the original repo, I think coming out with history and
</I>&gt;<i> tags in tact is the best we can do.

Git has a very good Subversion converter.

Just saying. I don't care what version control system you use as long as 
Cryopid will be maintained. :)
