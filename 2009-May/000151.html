<PRE>&gt;<i> - There are some blank line insertions, though at this point I doubt
</I>&gt;<i> anyone really cares. Its a matter of c-style and (I too) like a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> space between preprocessors and actual code beginning, however in
</I>&gt;<i> functions it can get confusing, since a newline typically segments the
</I>&gt;<i> flow of the code.
</I>
&quot;indent -kr -ts4&quot;, ftw!  :)

&gt;<i> - We (those of us working on it) need to have a discussion regarding
</I>&gt;<i> legacy kernel support .. and how many backwards compatibility kludges
</I>&gt;<i> we're comfortable with. Linux is a moving target .. perhaps some cut off
</I>&gt;<i> point needs to be established. 
</I>
I think this ties in a bit with future features .. if you feel that cryopid might take
advantage of 2.6.x-level features in the near future, we should just focus on 2.6.x as a
target, but it would be very useful to have 2.4.x support as well.  It really depends on
how you see the codebase changing in the future - what features you want to add, and
whether this would get in the way of simply maintaining 2.4.x compatability.  If the push
comes to shove, you could always just maintain a 2.4.x-compatible patchset and expose it
through the sharesource site .. testing when major code changes require, of course.

FWIW, I'm using cryopid as a way of understanding process control from user space, and in
that effort it is very handy.  But from a 'snapshot'-oriented production application of
cryopid, I imagine 2.4.x support is definitely useful.  Lots of production systems still
use a 2.4.x kernel for various reasons, in my experience ..
