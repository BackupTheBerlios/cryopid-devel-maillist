I'll contact you off list for github, for ShareSource, simply sign up at
<A HREF="http://sharesource.org">http://sharesource.org</A> and send me your user name.

Anyone else who needs commit access, or even access to update the wiki,
etc, please let me know.

I'm looking at it now. A couple of things come to mind:

- There are some blank line insertions, though at this point I doubt
anyone really cares. Its a matter of c-style and (I too) like a bit of
space between preprocessors and actual code beginning, however in
functions it can get confusing, since a newline typically segments the
flow of the code.

- Instead of getpagesize(), can we use a static _getpagesize() that
looks for PAGE_SIZE being defined on the command line? If defined, it
just uses that value. That should be agreeably inlined by gcc and saves
numerous jumps and calls to sysconf, since we can get the value via
autoconf (while obeying what the user thinks it should be).

- We (those of us working on it) need to have a discussion regarding
legacy kernel support .. and how many backwards compatibility kludges
we're comfortable with. Linux is a moving target .. perhaps some cut off
point needs to be established. I can work around all of that with
preprocessor soup that I get from autoconf, but really, its going to get
ugly and difficult to maintain. 2.6.24 sounds good to me, but I'd like
to hear from others.

I'll be able to take a closer look in a few hours, I'll send any
additional comments then.

I know this was a pain in the ass, thank you for doing it!

Cheers,
--Tim
