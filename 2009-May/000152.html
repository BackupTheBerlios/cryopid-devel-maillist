Thanks.

&gt;<i> - There are some blank line insertions, though at this point I doubt
</I>&gt;<i> anyone really cares. Its a matter of c-style and (I too) like a bit of

</I>
I think that blank line are good to divide logically the code, even inside
the functions. But I don't know, I don't care.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Instead of getpagesize(), can we use a static _getpagesize() that
</I>&gt;<i> looks for PAGE_SIZE being defined on the command line? If defined, it
</I>&gt;<i> just uses that value. That should be agreeably inlined by gcc and saves
</I>&gt;<i> numerous jumps and calls to sysconf, since we can get the value via
</I>&gt;<i> autoconf (while obeying what the user thinks it should be).
</I>
The problems with previous cryopid version is there, PAGE_SIZE. Latest
libc, kernel headers changed that. I'm ok with static _getpagesize() to
avoid too much calls to sysconf, but I don't think define PAGE_SIZE on the
command line is ok because PAGE_SIZE is system depending.
What about a global variable that store getpagesize() value? or something
similar with macros?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - We (those of us working on it) need to have a discussion regarding
</I>&gt;<i> legacy kernel support .. and how many backwards compatibility kludges
</I>&gt;<i> we're comfortable with. Linux is a moving target .. perhaps some cut off

</I>&gt;<i> preprocessor soup that I get from autoconf, but really, its going to get
</I>&gt;<i> ugly and difficult to maintain. 2.6.24 sounds good to me, but I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to hear from others.
</I>
It's ok for me. I don't know if people still uses 2.4 version.
ciao
