I was _really_ hoping to preserve the history and tags from the original
SVN. What I'll do is a git / hg import based on the Mercurial repository
that has these things in tact. The initial conversion from SVN was very
difficult.

I'm kind of sticky about that because we will surely need to go back in
the commit history (i.e. to bisect). Given the complexity of the code
and sparse comments / documentation, the history is all we have to go
by.

&gt;<i> &gt;If so, please go ahead and just push it to github.

I'll do the convert from hg to git (should be seamless) then push it to
github. As soon as sharesource supports git (I'm told its only a week or
so away before its stable), we can just move the github repo there.

That lets us keep both the hg repo and git repo in sync, which is really
cool.

&gt;<i> I tested it on a 2.6.28.9 kernel. I don't use 2.4.
</I>&gt;<i> Ciao
</I>
Please go ahead and send the patch, I'll apply it after I do the git
conversion. I also need to get you commit access at sharesource (and
github while its in use).

I think the best way to go for now is post patches to the list noting
that they will be committed in a week unless anyone has comments /
questions / issues .. and hooks can be set up to send commit notices to
this list.

Cheers,
--Tim
