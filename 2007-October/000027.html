Hi Bruno,

|<i> cp_r_sighand.o: In function `rt_sigaction':
</I>|<i> arch/arch.h:27: undefined reference to `syscall'
</I>|<i> collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
</I>|<i> make: *** [stub-gzip] Error 1
</I>|<i> rm stub_common.o
</I>
Yes, I hit exactly this problem too when I tried to compile on a 64-bit
system. I'd like to have someone knowledgeable suggest what to do.

|<i> I saw that I'm not the only one having this problem, but no solution has

</I>
What I can offer is a solution that got CryoPID to *compile* (but read
on before trying it). In &quot;src/Makefile&quot; find the line with the
comment:

  # How do we get our libc linked into the stub?

Following that there are two &quot;LIBC = ...&quot; options, with one commented
out. Try uncommenting that and commenting the other one instead. As I
say, that got CyryoPID to compile for me. In case it's relevant, I
also had to change &quot;linux/user.h&quot; into &quot;sys/user.h&quot; in a few places
since my system didn't have the former anywhere.

But the resulting &quot;freeze&quot; seems to fail for me in spectacular
fashion. I tried it on the OCaml toplevel. The process seemed to save
as usual. But restarting the image not only failed but appeared to
bring down my machine! I tried it twice to convince myself that it
wasn't a coincidence. But since the system is one where I don't have
the root password or even physical access to the console, I can't say
what went wrong. And I didn't want to make our sysadmin unlock the
machine room and reboot a third time.

John.

P.S. &quot;uname -a&quot; tells me that my system is:

  Linux 2.6.9-1.906_ELsmp #1 SMP Sun Dec 12 23:05:02 EST 2004 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

and /etc/motd says:

  OS:   Redhat EL3 - Kernel Version 2.4.21-12 (64-bit)
