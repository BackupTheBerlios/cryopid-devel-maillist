Hi Bernard,

|<i> &gt; So I poked around a
</I>|<i> &gt; bit for alternatives and found CryoPID, which seems to be exactly what
</I>|<i> &gt; I want.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> Awesome! So you're using the x86_64 version successfully?
</I>
Not myself, but other people apparently are. I still find it attractive
just because it builds reliably on the recent Linuxes I've tried,
whereas ckpt is often problematic. 

|<i> &gt; So my question is: should I expect to be able to create reasonably
</I>|<i> &gt; portable binaries in this way, or am I asking too much? Is there
</I>|<i> &gt; something else I can do to support it?
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> I've seen unpredictable crashes moving between some machines, but never 
</I>|<i> got to trace down the cause. In theory it should be possible to make the 
</I>|<i> binaries &quot;portable enough&quot;, so long as we can fool the kernel into 
</I>|<i> putting things where they should be. So far I've just been debugging 
</I>|<i> vaguely reproducable crashes and finding their cause (and once you know 
</I>|<i> what's causing it, it's reasonably easy to work around in most cases). 
</I>|<i> But I haven't worked on Cryopid in some time, and am still as behind as 
</I>|<i> ever. Mark O'Neill has some awesome patches to add RT support, in-flight 
</I>|<i> data in FIFOs and more, which I've been meaning to put up on the site. 
</I>|<i> And I promise I will soon! (A week or two - still travelling atm).
</I>
Sounds good! If you ever do have any more time to look at this issue
with OCaml, I can work more closely with you. It's not a showstopper, 
but it would be very attractive to be able to distribute completely
portable binaries.

|<i> &gt; I also have another more minor question. I see that support for
</I>|<i> &gt; preserving the PID is one of the &quot;planned&quot; features. Is this likely to
</I>|<i> &gt; happen soon? I'd certainly find it a rather convenient addition.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> That stalled, awaiting support for pid containers and virtual pids to be 
</I>|<i> merged into mainline kernel. The patches were tossed around lkml several 
</I>|<i> times last year, but weren't merged. I'm not sure what the current 
</I>|<i> status is, but as soon as it is merged, preserving PIDs will be trivial :)
</I>
And it would also make CryoPID's name more appropriate :-)

By the way, do you know of any usable checkpointing packages for
Mac OS X or Windows? I've searched a bit and never really found anything.
But then I only found out about CryoPID relatively recently because I
was relying on a rather old list at &quot;www.checkpointing.org&quot;.

John.
