Ahh. I know Ocaml does crazy things with binaries, but I just tested
it on some, built with either with ocamlc and ocamlopt, and it
seemed happy. Obviously, that's not to say its foolproof, but if you
can isolate a binary which dies (or even better, a scenario), I'll
try and dig in when I get a chance.

Not that I'm aware of. I once had ambitious goals to 'port' CryoPID
to FreeBSD and potentially Darwin, but those days are gone (oh, to
be a uni student again).

I've no idea about Windows and know nothing of its internals. I'm
sure it's possible (as is anything) - interestingly, Microsoft is
now making internal OS sources to some versions of Windows available
to universities for research purposes.  I reckon this would be a
pretty awesome reason for getting at them, so if anybody is
pondering undertaking this project, let me know. I know at least one
university that is involved in this program.

Cheers,

Bernard.
