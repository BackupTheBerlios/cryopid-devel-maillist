<PRE>
I've been using CryoPID for a few months now, and I've been very
impressed with it. I have a couple of questions, but maybe first I
should explain in general terms how I'm using it.

I'm the author of a theorem-proving program that's built inside the
read-eval print loop of the OCaml programming language. (See
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/hol-light/</A>&quot;.) OCaml, in contrast to
some other functional language implementations, has no facility for
saving and restoring a session, so I'm using checkpointing programs as
a substitute. For a while I was using &quot;ckpt&quot;, which worked very well.
However, it doesn't work in 64-bit mode, and many people have
encountered issues building it on recent Linuxes. So I poked around a
bit for alternatives and found CryoPID, which seems to be exactly what
I want.

One further thing I'd rather like to do is distribute checkpointed
images from CryoPID as binaries, to make installation for others
trivial. For a little while I was excited to see that this seemed to
work fine (using &quot;-l&quot;). However, it later turned out that there were
various problems running binaries created on one platform on others.
The most notable was signal handling: on control/C, the program would
just exit at once instead of dropping me back in the read-eval-print
loop. I also encountered other cases where the program would
unpredictably exit for no obvious reason. (On the platform where the
image was created, everything worked perfectly.)

So my question is: should I expect to be able to create reasonably
portable binaries in this way, or am I asking too much? Is there
something else I can do to support it?

I also have another more minor question. I see that support for
preserving the PID is one of the &quot;planned&quot; features. Is this likely to
happen soon? I'd certainly find it a rather convenient addition.

John.
