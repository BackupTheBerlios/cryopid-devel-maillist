How do these systems set the start of VDSO by default? If the mmap min
addr is set, there's a very good chance that VDSO also lives in some
random place per process.

At last count, there were ~15 exploits due to VDSO being static.

I'm still inclined to think that the best policy (for now) is to insist
on compat VDSO as well as the legacy starting address. I know it sucks,
but this is starting to dive into dealing with randomization.

However, you are correct. I think its worth changing the wiki to explain
that frozen processes (on modern distros) can only be restored on the
same system that froze them while in the current state that the freezing
took place.

I think there's a lot of work and research to do.

Cheers,
