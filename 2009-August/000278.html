I'm catching up with all of your patches now and testing (to the best of
my ability on a Xen farm). Sorry to be absent lately, I just got over a
really wretched case of salmonella. I'll send comments soon.

PTRACE_KILL was problematic in some pre-2.6 versions but I don't see any
reason to not use it.

Awesome! That was on my to-do list.

I'm about 60% through introducing autoconf, its actually turned out to
be a lot more work than I anticipated. There are about a dozen member
changes in various exposed kernel structures from 2.4 to current
linux-stable, so its a lot of conditional code. Its going to be a while
before I'm comfortable pushing that.

I think we'll end up having to make a separate 2.4 branch and back port
stuff that is desirable from the main development branch. This is going
to limit the amount of ugly conditional code as well as ease the
headache of dealing with quirks known in old versions of gcc.

What I'd like to do (now) is implement the dotfile for default
configuration options and make the output of freeze less noisy by
default. Then, add some run time checks (such as VDSO randomization)
which can warn the user that the process may not unfreeze as expected.

And, of course the libc upgrade. 

After that, we can probably see about getting Cryopid back into debian
proper. I think between all who have been participating, enough brain
power exists to handle any new bugs rather quickly.

Cheers,
--Tim
