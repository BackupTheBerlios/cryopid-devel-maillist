Some basic checks are done in the Makefile (one specifically to turn of
stack protection if the compiler supports it) but they aren't quite
reliable.

There's also a depreciated call to `arch' which won't work on some newer
systems, since `arch' was done away with (in favor of uname).

If patches to bring in autoconf would be accepted, I'd be happy to do
most of the work. These would not introduce automake, just checking for
lib / tool chain sanity and path/option configuration. Since this is
very Linux centric, I doubt that even config.h would be used as there
are no alternatives to some things. I probably wouldn't bother
generating it.

There's enough snippets in the m4/autoconf macro archive to do most of
what is now done with the ifeq switchboard in the Makefile.

Cheers,
--Tim
